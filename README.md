# ITCO - IT Services Website

A multi-page React application built for an IT services and consulting company. This project was put together to showcase responsive design, modern UI components, and client-side routing using React.

## What's Inside

- **Multi-Page Layout**: Fully functioning routing for all pages (Home, About, Services, Team, Contact, Blog Details).
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap to ensure everything looks solid on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Dynamic Sliders**: Used `react-slick` for the client testimonials and brand carousels.
- **Reusable Components**: Extracted UI elements like the Newsletter CTA and Header/Footer to keep the codebase clean and DRY.
- **Interactive Forms**: Contact and newsletter forms with clean inline state feedback.

## Tech Stack

- React (v18)
- Vite (for super fast bundling and HMR)
- React Router DOM (v6)
- Bootstrap 5 & Bootstrap Icons
- React Slick (Carousels)
- Vanilla CSS (for custom styling and component overrides)

## Getting Started

If you want to spin this up locally, it's pretty straightforward.

1. **Get the code**: Clone the repo or download the folder.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open up your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite throws at you).
